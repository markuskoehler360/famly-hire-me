# My Solution?

## Setup
- clone the repository
- run ```npm install```
- if you don't have vite installed run ```npm install -D vite```
- create .env by copying .env.example and fill in access-token
- run ```npm run dev```

## My Thoughts
- @coreui/coreui was used to keep styling to a minimum
- after receiving the first array of children, I used https://quicktype.io/typescript and created a Child interface to enable autocomplete for the object's properties
- React-Query was used to synchronize with the backend. I could have also used a more simpler approach by just using fetch() or axios, but I'm currently trying to get familiar with React-Query. I've been using RxJS while working with Angular, but want to broaden my React knowledge.

- Create a small application in React (or another agreed upon framework)
- Describe your design decisions and setup instructions in the README.md of the forked repository

## The assignment
You are tasked to build a simple application for a nursery to manage the attendance of children each day.

It has to be done using Typescript.

The application should be able to do 3 things:
1. List children with some form of pagination/lazy-loading/infinite-scroll
2. Checkin a child
3. Checkout a child

Don't worry about design or anything like that.

If you have any questions feel free to reach out to the person who sent you the assignment ‚ò∫Ô∏è
